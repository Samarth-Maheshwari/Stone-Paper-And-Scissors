# Stone-Paper-And-Scissors
Creating a Stone Paper Scissors game for the web involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple and interactive application. 
The HTML sets up the structure, including buttons for the player to choose between stone, paper, and scissors, and a display area for showing the results. 
CSS styles the game, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly, with appropriate layouts and button designs. 
JavaScript handles the core game logic: it listens for player input, randomly generates the computer's choice, compares the two choices to determine the winner, and updates the display with the result. Additionally, it may include features for tracking scores and resetting the game. The combination of these technologies results in an engaging and responsive game that can be played directly in a web browser.
